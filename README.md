## 👤 About Me

I'm Natalia Ryabova, currently assisting with Programming and Web Development cirricula while pursuing my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Harper College in Palatine, Illinois. I'm an experienced (almost) full-stack programmer, a tech enthusiast and a creative mind, aiming to bridge the gap between technology and people through elegant and efficient web solutions. When I'm not coding or studying, I enjoy contributing to open source and engaging with the tech community across my favorite forums.
